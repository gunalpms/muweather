# muweather
This is the repository for a demo weather app developed for MacOS

Muweather aims to be a resource efficient weather app for MacOS that operates primarily on the menu bar. 
MacOS's built-in weather widget has no option to place it on the menu bar and it only displays basic information, 
namely the city name, weather and temperatures. It fails to show other important information such as 
wind speed, wind direction, hourly forecast, weekly forecast and air pressure. 
Muweather solves this problem by integrating itself to the menu bar, displaying weather and temperature. 
Upon clicking the menu bar widget, all the information mentioned above is displayed in an elegant and simple drop down menu. 
It also allows for the addition of multiple cities, and the menu bar widget displays the city you set to be "primary". 
The fetch time for the information can be customized with intervals ranging from 30 seconds to 1 hour to allow the user 
to choose between the most upto date information or energy efficiency. The app is written in SwiftUI, making it compatible with a 
variety of MacOS versions and hardware. Overall this project has been made to provide a solution to retrieve weather information in 
an easier way compared to the native implementation within MacOS.
